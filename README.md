# "Summer Code Fest": Focus with M. Pomodoro Rajoy

## Introduction

This project is part of the `Summer Code Fest` (inspired by the "Summer Game Fest", probably one of the most terrible ideas we ever had as a society), and aims to practice the basics I couldn't explore in IT Academy's bootcamp. In this case, and after giving Next.js a try by creating a small [Spotify Replica](https://github.com/JuditKaramazov/SummerCodeFest-Spotify), I focused on some of the subjects mattering the most both to me and most of the Spanish citizens:

- The difficulty to `stay focused` during the summer.
- The unsettling feeling today's elections are eliciting from us.
- The relevant figure of Mariano Rajoy, which wasn't so great whenever politics were involved, but that became essential from a comical standpoint.
- The importance of learning and practicing `TypeScript` (`maybe` this isn't affecting the entire country, but it still `is` a crucial matter).

Considering this, I created a customized [M. Pomodoro Rajoy Timer](https://m-pomodoro-rajoy.vercel.app/) greatly inspired by some of our ex-president's most memorable quotes. Why? Because we all need to find the strength and courage to focus on our goals, wants, and wishes, and I believe that some of his emblematic sentences could fuel our spirit during difficult times. However, I do consider it essential to highlight that the intention of this small app is `not` based on attacking various ideologies and positions. Far the contrary, I would want this space to bring a smile to the ones struggling with their studies, work, and overall time management.

## Features & Style

After clarifying some crucial matters regarding the site's nature, allow me to explain what's the content you'll find by accessing this repository:

- A customizable timer, allowing the user to add and remove `5 minutes` each time the buttons are clicked.
- A `theme switcher`, which can result in a relaxing feature for users that prefer a `dark theme` instead of a `light one`.
- A `clickable Rajoy's image` featuring some of his greatest hits.
- A collection of different `playlists and songs` that represent both the Spanish nature of the app and the undeniable comedy we all need to keep on keeping on.

As for the `playlists` that I decided to incorporate, they belong to [808 INC](https://www.youtube.com/@808inc6), [Himnos Sinton√≠as PP](https://www.youtube.com/@HimnosPPopulares) (I strongly recommend this specific channel - it's a gem!), and [Relaxosaurus](https://www.youtube.com/@relaxosaurus8407), respectively. Thank you all for such great contributions - and big Kudos to the ones sharing their art with others, like [Caricaturas Vagas](http://caricaturasvagas.blogspot.com/). You are awesome!

Please note that while I'm trying my best to improve and explore different technologies, tools and possibilities, there might be some inconsistencies. However, and as it happened with the previous app, I do found it essential to try our best to understand better wathever we are not familiarized with.
If that's also your case and you'd want to give coding a try...

# Vite ‚ö°

> Next Generation Frontend Tooling

- üí° Instant Server Start
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning Fast HMR
- üõ†Ô∏è Rich Features
- üì¶ Optimized Build
- üî© Universal Plugin Interface
- üîë Fully Typed APIs

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced [`/vit/`](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vitejs/vite@main/docs/public/vite.mp3), like "veet") is a new breed of frontend build tooling that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that serves your source files over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), with [rich built-in features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) and astonishingly fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).

- A [build command](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

In addition, Vite is highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.
